After a fulfilling decade in software engineering, split between Indonesia and Korea, I've grown significantly in my field. My approach combines hard work with creative problem-solving, which has served me well. However, the rise of AI, particularly since the advent of ChatGPT, has led me to rethink the future of software engineering. My reliance on ChatGPT for coding assistance and advice, replacing traditional resources like Google or Stack Overflow, underscores the transformative impact of AI.

This shift has prompted concerns about the diminishing value of human engineers in the face of AI's rapid advancement. While it's disheartening to consider AI outperforming humans in coding, it seems an inevitable progression. The potential for AI to enable anyone to create applications without programming knowledge is significant, despite challenges that AI must still overcome. Embracing and adapting to AI appears to be the most viable strategy for ensuring relevance in this evolving landscape.
