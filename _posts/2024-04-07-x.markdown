When I was 10, my father's business went bankrupt. The big house my family owned was taken by creditors, and we had to move to another small city. That's when I became addicted to computer games. I was out of control. My mom cried numerous times because of me, but I felt nothing. Rather, I told my parents not to interfere with my life.

Playing computer games without proper physical activities made me gain a lot of weight. Not only that, but it also affected my mental condition. I started suffering from some kind of paranoia even though I was not clinically diagnosed. It means I was stuck on one thought and couldn't escape from it for a long period of time.

The paranoia made the situation even worse. I started experiencing dyspnea. Simply put, I kept thinking I couldn't breathe. I went to see a doctor. He checked everything and told me that my physical state was normal and the dyspnea came from unhandled mental stress. He didn't tell me what to do. I was so terrified because I had been thinking something was physically wrong. Before reaching a tragic consequence, I had to do something to change my life.

I chose exercising. I started playing basketball 1 hour every day with my friends. After a few months, all the mentioned problems were magically gone. Not only did I lose my weight, but I also became free from paranoia and dyspnea. But there was a "good" side effect which I didn't expect in the first place. My academic achievement improved drastically.

That's when I realized the relationship between physical activities and academic achievement. I realized that if we mix two things (being physically active + studying hard), the result will be dramatic. That shouldn't be "choose either A or B." Simply putting, being physically active activates our brain which enables us to study more efficiently.

When I turned 30, I decided which exercise to do for the rest of my life. My conclusion is walking. When it comes to calorie burning, walking is relatively inefficient compared to other physically demanding exercises. But I favor walking for the following reasons:

1. It can be done anytime and anywhere.
2. It involves the whole body, especially when we walk fast.
3. It allows us to do a side activity while walking.
4. It costs nothing except that shoes wear out quickly.

I started walking 8000 steps a day when I was 30. Now, I walk 14000 steps a day, which takes 130 minutes. Each step not only contributed to my physical health but also to my mental clarity and emotional well-being. The simplicity of walking, the rhythm, and the repetitive motion provided a space for me to process thoughts, come up with creative ideas, and sometimes, just enjoy the beauty of the present moment.

Endless stamina, a strong back, and resilience to stress are just bonuses.
